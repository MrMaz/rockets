# Rockets NestJS Password

A flexible Password utilities module that provides services for password strength, creation and storage.

## Overview

The module exports three services: `PasswordStrengthService`, `PasswordCreationService`, and `PasswordStorageService`.

The `PasswordCreationService` uses the `PasswordStrengthService` internally for check password strength.

## Installation

`yarn add @concepta/nestjs-password`

## TODO

*   Make all services overridable at time of registration.
