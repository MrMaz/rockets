# Rockets NestJS Authentication

Authenticate requests using one or more strategies (local, jwt, etc).

All of the strategies require that this module be registered by the app, as it provides a set of shared services
they use to validate users as well as issue and verify tokens.

## Installation

`yarn add @concepta/nestjs-authentication`
