# Rockets NestJS Events

Advanced class based event dispatch/listener module.

This module extends/wraps the [eventemitter2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eventemitter2) module.

The goal is to enable a pattern where modules can export re-usable events and listener classes that can be easily consumed by their dependent modules.

## Installation

`yarn add @concepta/nestjs-event`

## TODO

*   Add class/method decorators
