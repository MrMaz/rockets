<center><h3>Rapid Enterprise Development Toolkit</h3></center>

The Rockets API library is a collection of NestJS modules that were created for the rapid development of enterpise level APIs.

Through over 15 years of experience, we have made enterprise-level development more agile. Rockets is a combination of all these lessons, best practices and tools packaged and made available to you.

  Currently used internally at [Concepta](https://conceptatech.com) to build enterprise applications. However, it is
  still in the experimental development stages. Major APIs will change until the
  1.0 release.
