# Rockets NestJS Library

The Rockets NestJS library is a collection of modules that were created
for the rapid development of enterpise level APIs.

All reasonable efforts have been made to provide loosely coupled interfaces,
overridable services, and sane default implementations.

This project is currently in alpha testing, however, feedback is highly
appreciated and encouraged!
