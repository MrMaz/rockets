## Proposal

<!--
     Briefly but precisely describe what you would like Rockets to be able to do.

     Consider attaching images showing what you are imagining.

     Does this have to be provided by Rockets directly, or can it be provided
     by a package/plugin? If so, maybe consider implementing and
     publishing such a package rather than filing a bug.
